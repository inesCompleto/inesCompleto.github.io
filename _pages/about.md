I am a Postdoc in the Computational Neuroscience Lab led by Claudia Clopath at Imperial College London. Since joining the Clopath’s group, I have been working on network models of memory consolidation. I’m interested in studying how the hippocampus and mPFC interact and support memory formation at different stages.

Fields of interest: calcium-based synaptic plasticity models, mean-field models, hippocampal microcircuits, hippocampal theta rhythm, hippocampo-cortical mechanisms of memory consolidation
