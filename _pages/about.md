I am a researcher in **Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience**, interested in studying the cellular and circuit mechanisms of memory encoding. 

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the **University College London (UCL)**, where I am studying the maturation of networks for spatial memory by combining analysis of electrophysiological recordings and modeling of neural networks. Previous to this, I worked as a postdoc in the Clopath Lab at **Imperial College London**, studying how the hippocampus and mPFC interact and support memory formation at different stages, and completed my PhD at **École Normale Supérieure** (Paris) where I combined biophysical and mean-field models to investigate the generation of theta rhythm in a septal-entorhinal-hippocampal circuit.


**Fields of interest:** calcium-based synaptic plasticity models, mean-field models, hippocampal microcircuits, hippocampal theta rhythm, hippocampo-cortical mechanisms of memory consolidation
